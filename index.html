        <div id="bigBox"><strong>Day One Bio</strong></div>
          <p> Hi! Welcome to easily the simplest page in the class! I'm Jason and
          I'm new to pretty much everything in this environment.
          Looking to learn and thrive.
          But for now, this is my first day bio.
          Gonna be fun!</p>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I don't have a lot of experience at all. Looking to play catch-up and get going.
          Hoping my design background will come into play once I get to a good level of comfort.
          Class is already a little overwhelming, but it is fascinating and fun, too.</p>

          <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>I'm basically doing a career reboot, starting now.</p>
            <p>After graduating from Clemson, I went into the printing industry,
              then advertising, then after a brief battle with unemployment,
              began work at a local restaurant/bar.</p>
            <p>After spending the past 12 years in the food and beverage industry,
              but not getting many mental challenges, I'm going a whole different direction.</p>
            <p>Hoping to learn new skills to exist in the modern world.
              Would love to create "the next big thing" in a web app.
              Sounds like a lot of fun and hard work!</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A little intimidation at the volume of information.</li>
            <li>My inexperience with html and CSS.</li>
            <li>My typing skills are a little slow.</li>
            <li>Unfamiliarity with the Terminal.</li>
          </ul>
